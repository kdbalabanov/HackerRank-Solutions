# HackerRank Solutions

I use this project to track my HackerRank solutons. Problem statements and solutions are separated in "ProblemStatements" and "Solutions" folders. Each category/language has its own folder with subfolders where subcategories are present. The problem statements and their corresponding solutions have matching names.

Languages/topics explored so far: Java 8, Python 3, JavaScript, C++, SQL, Scala, Regular Expressions, LinuxShell.

More details can be found on my HackerRank [profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/k_d_balabanov).
